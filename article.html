     <p>Engineers are people who solve problems and focus on making things work more efficiently and effectively. They apply the theories and principles of science and mathematics to research and develop economical solutions to technical problems. That is the definition of an Engineer. Agreed. But who are the engineering students? They are often the ones who are overburdened with their assignments, deprived of sleep, low on social life (maybe) and busy in their own world of sci-fi movies and series. In this article, we have tried to compile, in pictures, what all engineering students go through.
